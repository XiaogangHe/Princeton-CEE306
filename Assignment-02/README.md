# The second assignment 
For this assignment, we will use [xarray] (http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) to manipulate NetCDF files. If you are not familiar with the NetCDF format, [here] (https://github.com/jsignell/intro-to-netcdf#introduction-to-netcdf) is a nice introduction.

To install xarray, just type the following command in your terminal:
`conda install xarray`
