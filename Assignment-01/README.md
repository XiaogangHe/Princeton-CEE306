# The first assignment 

## You need to install the following R packages:

- [Kendall] (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Kendall/index.html): for trend analysis
- [strucchange] (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/strucchange/index.html): for change point analysis
- [ismev] (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ismev/index.html): for extreme value analysis 

If you are a **Mac** user, simply type `R` in your terminal and use the following commands to install packages:
- `install.packages("Kendall")`
- `install.packages("strucchange")`
- `install.packages("ismev")`

If you are a **Windows** user, you can install the above R packages through Python. Please refer to this [notebook] (https://github.com/XiaogangHe/Princeton-CEE306/blob/master/Assignment-01/PyScripts/install_r_packages.ipynb) for details.
